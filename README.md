Build ML Regression models that would predict the value of the particular commodity 

 
Objective: Describe and analyse the crucial factors that will cause a change in freight movement value in the U.S.A. The ultimate goal is to provide predictions on the value of the particular commodity which is transported within the states of the U.S.A and from the U.S.A to different countries in a year. 
 
Outcome: We were able to build ML Regression models that would predict the value of the particular commodity which is transported within the states of the U.S.A and from the U.S.A to different countries in a year.
